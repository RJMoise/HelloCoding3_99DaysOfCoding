Notes:

This meta tag ensures that the display width is always appropriate for the device the webpage is being viewed on:
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, inital-scale=1">

<h1> tags help search engines find your page and determine relevance! Use it wisely. BUT do not use more than one or you could be considered spam.

Put all headers under a <header> tag so they can all be easily styled at once.

Only use images that are copyright free so you do not get taken down.

<a href="#top">Home</a> is an Anchor tag that acts like a link. This can be used instead of buttons in the right scenario. Whatever comes after the # must be a tags id if you want it to jump to that part of the page.

id's are names you can give tags so they can be easily referenced

HTML is for the content of the site
CSS is for the visual appeal
