# My 99 days of coding journey

I will be using an online course called Hello Coding 3 - 99 Days of Coding which I purchased from Kickstarter.
The content of those courses will not be shared here, only the end result of the various lessons.

Goals:
- Code consitantly 
- Learn new skills in various languages
- Learn GIT CLI in the process

This is not meant to help anyone but myself so I apologize in advance if you stop by and any content in this repo does not make sense.
