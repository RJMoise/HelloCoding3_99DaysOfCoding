document.querySelectorAll(".playerMove"); queries a document and selects all elements with the class .playerMove, which we gave to our three buttons. This will let us control them via Javascript.


buttons.forEach(button => {
    button.addEventListener("click", startRound);
});



buttons.forEach(); For each item in buttons, do what is defined in the curly brackets

button => {} refers to the specific button we are looping through. Whatever is written in the brackets is applied to the button

button.addEventListener("click", startRound); whenever there is a click event, call the function startRound.

`Player: ${this.textContent}` is the same as "Player: " + this.textContent;
